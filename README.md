# go-domains

In the provided Go code, several DNS (Domain Name System) lookups are performed to gather information about a given domain. Here's an explanation of MX records, SPF records, and DMARC records, as well as how Go performs DNS lookups:

MX Records:

MX stands for Mail Exchange. MX records are DNS records that specify the mail server responsible for receiving email on behalf of a domain. These records contain information about the mail server's hostname and priority.
In the code, net.LookupMX(domain) is used to perform a DNS lookup for MX records associated with the given domain. The result (mxRecords) contains a list of mail servers and their priorities.
SPF Records:

SPF stands for Sender Policy Framework. SPF records are DNS records that specify which mail servers are allowed to send emails on behalf of a particular domain. They help prevent email spoofing and phishing.
The code uses net.LookupTXT(domain) to retrieve all TXT records associated with the domain. It then looks for a TXT record starting with "v=spf1", indicating the presence of an SPF record.
DMARC Records:

DMARC stands for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance. DMARC records are used to enhance email authentication and provide instructions for handling emails that fail SPF or DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) checks.
The code looks up a specific TXT record (_dmarc.domain) using net.LookupTXT("_dmarc." + domain) to find DMARC records associated with the domain. It searches for records starting with "v=DMARC1".
Go's net package provides functionalities for DNS lookups (LookupMX, LookupTXT, etc.) allowing developers to query DNS servers for various types of records associated with a domain. These functions utilize the underlying DNS resolution capabilities provided by the operating system or network libraries to perform these lookups.

By analyzing these records, one can ascertain the mail server configurations (MX), email authentication policies (SPF), and email handling instructions (DMARC) for a particular domain, aiding in understanding its email infrastructure and security measures.
